https://github.com/plutext uses Microsoft office file formats (docx, pptx and elsx) to generate the Java API with Jaxb.

They also include supports for svg (https://github.com/plutext/JAXB-classes-for-SVG), but not complete.

com.siteview.jaxb.svg11 is generated from svg dtd, with modifications.
com.siteview.jaxb.svg11.example is the example to use the generated Jaxb binding.
